            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                AI Jargon Explainer ("the App") is developed by Harel Asaf. This Privacy Policy
                explains how the App handles your information. Your privacy is important, and the
                App is designed to minimize data collection. The App does not collect, store, or
                share personal data.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How the App Works</h2>
            <p>
                AI Jargon Explainer is a custom keyboard extension for iOS. When you copy text
                to your clipboard and tap the "Explain" button, the App reads the clipboard
                content, sends it to the Google Gemini API, and displays a plain-English
                explanation of AI-related jargon.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>
                    <strong>We do not collect any personal data.</strong> The App does not require
                    user accounts, does not use analytics or tracking services, and does not gather
                    device identifiers or usage statistics.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Processed Locally on Your Device</h2>
            <p>The following data is stored entirely on your device and is never transmitted to any server:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>API Key</strong> &mdash; Your Google Gemini API key is stored locally on your device using UserDefaults via App Groups. It is never sent to any server other than Google's Gemini API for authentication.</li>
                <li><strong>Bookmarked Terms</strong> &mdash; Terms you choose to save are stored locally on your device using UserDefaults. They are not transmitted anywhere.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Clipboard Access</h2>
            <p>
                The App reads your clipboard <strong>only</strong> when you explicitly tap the
                "Explain" button. The clipboard content is used solely to generate an explanation
                and is not stored, logged, or transmitted to any party other than the Google
                Gemini API for processing. The App never reads your clipboard in the background
                or without your direct action.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clipboard access requires that you enable "Allow Full Access" for the keyboard
                extension in your device's Settings. Without Full Access, the App cannot read
                the clipboard or make network requests.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
                The App sends your clipboard text to the <strong>Google Gemini API</strong> to
                generate explanations. This is the only third-party service used by the App. The
                text is sent directly from your device to Google's servers for processing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Google's handling of data sent to the Gemini API is governed by
                <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Privacy Policy</a>
                and the
                <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini API Terms of Service</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The App does <strong>not</strong> use any analytics services, advertising
                frameworks, crash reporting tools, or other third-party SDKs.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>
                The App does not share your data with third parties. The only external
                communication is sending clipboard text to the Google Gemini API when you
                explicitly request an explanation. No data is sold, rented, or disclosed to
                advertisers, data brokers, or any other entities.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
                The App does not retain any data on external servers. All locally stored data
                (your API key and bookmarked terms) remains on your device and can be deleted
                at any time by removing the App.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                Your API key and bookmarked terms are stored using iOS UserDefaults within an
                App Group container, which is sandboxed by the iOS operating system. Network
                requests to the Google Gemini API are made over HTTPS, ensuring that data in
                transit is encrypted.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly
                collect any personal information from children. Since the App does not collect
                personal data from any user, no special provisions for children's data are
                necessary.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>
                Since the App does not collect or store personal data on any server, there is no
                personal data to access, correct, or delete remotely. All data stored by the App
                resides on your device and is fully under your control. You can delete all App
                data by uninstalling the App from your device.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be
                reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of
                the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
